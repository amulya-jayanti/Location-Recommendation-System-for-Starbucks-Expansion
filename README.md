# Location-Recommendation-System-for-Starbucks-Expansion
Built a Location Scoring System using ML models (XGBoost, Random Forest, Neural Networks) on 20+ datasets (Google Places, US Census, OpenStreetMap) with >10M data rows covering POIs, demographics, city boundaries and Isochrones, to predict store revenue potential and guide strategic expansion identifying both high-revenue and underserved potential locations.

**Project Overview:**

Starbucks, a global coffeehouse leader, operates thousands of locations worldwide. While some stores thrive, others underperform ‚Äî often due to suboptimal site selection, leading to revenue loss and store closures. This project introduces a scalable, data-driven approach to help Starbucks identify high-potential locations for offline expansion and optimize capital expenditure.

**Problem Statement:**

The Challenge:\
How can Starbucks predict which new store locations are likely to succeed based on demographic, geographic, and competitive data?

The Goal:\
To develop a machine learning pipeline that:

Predicts the likelihood of store success using location-specific features\
Supports smart, data-informed decisions for new store openings

**Data Overview:**

Dataset	Description:

Points of Interest (POIs)	Restaurants, cafes, retail stores, hotels, supermarkets (Google Places API, OSM, Kaggle)\
Demographics	Block-level population, income, age, gender (Census)\
City Boundaries	Geometries of top 20 cities (OpenStreetMap)\
Isochrones	Walking/driving coverage from Starbucks locations (Mapbox)

Data Preparation & Feature Engineering:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Buffer-Based Features\
Created 500m and 1000m buffers around each Starbucks\
Counted POIs by category within each buffer\
Example: number_of_fast_food_restaurants_within_1000m

2Ô∏è‚É£ Isochrone-Based Features\
Generated 5- and 10-minute walking and driving isochrones\
Counted POIs within each time-based reach\
Example: number_of_supermarkets_within_10min_drive

3Ô∏è‚É£ Demographic Features\
Income: % households in income brackets (e.g., $60k‚Äì$100k)\
Age: % population by age group\
Gender: Male and female distributions\
Example: pct_households_60_100k

**Pre-Modeling & Feature Selection:**

üìä Kruskal-Wallis Test
Non-parametric test used to check if features significantly differentiate high- vs. low-rated stores.

üå≤ Boruta (Tree-Based Models)
Feature selection method that iteratively removes features less important than randomized "shadow features".

üß† Machine Learning Models

üéØ Classification Task\
Target: Binary label ‚Äì Store rating above or below 4 stars

Model	Train AUC	Test AUC\
Logistic Regression	0.61	0.68\
XGBoost	0.65	0.64

**Metrics:**

Model	Class	Precision	Recall	F1-score\
Logistic	0	0.63	0.50	0.56\
1	0.68	0.78	0.73\
XGBoost	0	0.59	0.54	0.57\
1	0.68	0.72	0.70

üìù F1-score is crucial here:\
False negatives ‚Üí Missed opportunity\
False positives ‚Üí Capital loss on underperforming locations

üí° Key Insights from Feature Impact

Feature	Impact (%)	Insight\
Distance to Nearest Starbucks	-12.02%	- Avoid cannibalizing nearby high-rated stores\
% Households earning $60k‚Äì$100k	-9.22% - Strong correlation with better performance\
Presence of Fast Food Restaurants	-8.61%	- Negative impact due to brand dilution\
% Population aged 18‚Äì24	-8.41%	- Young adults correlate with higher store ratings\
Supermarkets within 10-min drive	-7.28%	- Attract consistent footfall\
Budget Hotels Nearby	-5.54% -	May negatively affect perception and pricing

**Post-Modeling Analysis:**

üîç SHAP Feature Importance\
Explains feature impact on individual predictions and global trends

üß≠ Recursive Geospatial Clustering (DBSCAN + Haversine)\
Reveals market areas, brand saturation, and expansion gaps\
Helps define micro-clusters of retail activity\
Identifies underrepresented neighborhoods with potential

**Recommendations:**

Open New Stores In:

Locations near existing high-rated Starbucks\
Neighborhoods with $60k‚Äì$100k income brackets\
Areas near supermarkets and lightly saturated zones

Avoid:

Fast-food dense areas (negative brand positioning)\
Budget hotel neighborhoods (price-conscious clientele)

**Future Work:**

Direction	- Description

Real-Time Footfall	- Use mobility data to refine traffic estimates\
Sentiment Analysis	- NLP on reviews to uncover quality/location feedback\
Competitor Modeling	- Assess impact of premium/local coffee shops\
Customer Feedback	- Incorporate service ratings and complaint patterns\
Urban Market Dynamics	- Segment cities and adapt strategies per local behavior
